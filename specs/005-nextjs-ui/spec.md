# Feature Specification: Next.js Document Processing App with Schema-Driven UI

**Feature Branch**: `005-build-a-next`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Next.js (App Router, TS) app using shadcn/ui and Tailwind where uploaded documents are treated as structured data sources with predefined schemas, showing empty forms/tables auto-filled by AI JSON results, with a minimal neutral UI (sidebar for document types/history, main area for uploader + schema form/table, sober colors, modern font, clear spacing, minimal text, inline edits, validation, save/export)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business user needs to extract structured data from various document types (invoices, receipts, forms) by uploading them to a web application. The system should automatically identify the document type, present an appropriate empty form/table based on a predefined schema, and fill in the fields using AI analysis of the uploaded document. Users should be able to review, edit, and export the extracted data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to the document processing app, **When** they upload a document (PDF/image), **Then** the system displays an appropriate empty form based on the document type schema
2. **Given** an empty form is displayed, **When** AI processes the uploaded document, **Then** the form fields are automatically populated with extracted data
3. **Given** a populated form with extracted data, **When** the user reviews and edits field values, **Then** changes are saved and validation feedback is provided
4. **Given** a completed form with extracted data, **When** the user chooses to export, **Then** the data is available in multiple formats
5. **Given** multiple processed documents, **When** the user accesses the sidebar, **Then** they can view document type categories and processing history

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an uploaded document doesn't match any predefined schema?
- How does the system handle documents with poor image quality or corrupted files?
- What occurs when AI extraction confidence is low for certain fields?
- How does the system behave when required fields cannot be extracted from the document?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload documents in common formats (PDF, JPEG, PNG)
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically identify document types based on predefined schemas
- **FR-003**: System MUST display empty forms/tables that match the identified document schema
- **FR-004**: System MUST use AI to extract structured data from uploaded documents and populate form fields
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to edit extracted data with inline editing capabilities
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate field data according to schema rules and display validation feedback
- **FR-007**: System MUST save processed document data for future reference
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide export functionality for extracted data in multiple formats
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain a sidebar showing document type categories and processing history
- **FR-010**: System MUST present a clean, minimal user interface with neutral colors and clear spacing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for different document types (invoices, receipts, forms)
- **Uploaded Document**: User-submitted files that serve as data sources for extraction
- **Extracted Data**: Structured information extracted from documents, organized according to schema definitions
- **Processing History**: Record of previously processed documents and their extraction results
- **Document Type**: Category classification that determines which schema to apply to an uploaded document
