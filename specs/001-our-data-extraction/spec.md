# Feature Specification: Schema-Driven Document Data Extraction with Validation

**Feature Branch**: `001-our-data-extraction`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Ready  
**Input**: User description: "our data extraction project works well with open-weights vision-capable LLMs like Llama 4 Scout and Mistral Small 3.2
we obtain quasi accurate JSON extractions. we want to add the following feature: 
- specify the schema of the data to be extracted that are expected to be on the user-uploaded document. the extracted data should be validated with rules (required, format, ...). the schema should be defined via no-code UI. the schema will be provided to the AI as part of the prompt along with the uploaded document"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature clearly specified: schema definition with validation for document extraction
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: users uploading documents, AI models processing documents
   � Actions: define schema, upload documents, extract data, validate results
   � Data: document schemas, extracted JSON data, validation rules
   � Constraints: no-code interface requirement
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Clarified: supports images and PDFs as document formats
   � Clarified: validation feedback integrated into AI JSON output
   � Clarified: predefined document types with associated schemas
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: create schema � upload document � extract with validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Schema creation, document processing, validation, UI requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Schema, ValidationRule, Document, ExtractionResult
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user needs to extract structured data from image or PDF documents. The system provides predefined document types (National ID, Passport, Business License, etc.), each with its own schema defining expected fields and validation rules. The user selects the appropriate document type, uploads their document, and the system extracts data according to the schema, with validation feedback included in the AI's JSON output for each field.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** predefined document types are available, **When** user selects a document type (e.g., National ID), **Then** system displays the associated schema with field definitions and validation rules
2. **Given** a selected document type, **When** user uploads an image or PDF document, **Then** system extracts data according to the document type's schema and includes validation status in JSON output
3. **Given** a document with missing required fields, **When** extraction is performed, **Then** AI's JSON output includes validation failures for missing required fields
4. **Given** a document with incorrectly formatted fields, **When** extraction is performed, **Then** AI's JSON output includes field-specific validation errors and format issues

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded document is neither an image nor PDF?
- How does system handle extraction when document contains no recognizable data matching the selected document type's schema?
- What occurs when document type selection doesn't match the actual uploaded document content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide predefined document types (National ID, Passport, Business License, etc.) with associated schemas
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select a document type before uploading documents
- **FR-003**: System MUST support image and PDF document formats for upload and processing
- **FR-004**: Each document type MUST have a defined schema with field names, types, validation rules, and required/optional status
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate document type schema information into AI prompts during processing
- **FR-006**: AI MUST include validation status and feedback for each extracted field in the JSON output
- **FR-007**: System MUST present extraction results with embedded validation feedback from AI processing
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing document upload and AI extraction functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle cases where uploaded document doesn't match the selected document type
- **FR-010**: System MUST reject uploads that are not images or PDF files
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear error messages when document format is unsupported

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **DocumentType**: Predefined category (National ID, Passport, Business License) with associated schema and field definitions
- **Schema**: Template specifying expected fields and validation rules for a specific document type
- **Field**: Individual data element within a schema, including name, type, validation rules, and required/optional status
- **ValidationResult**: Field-level validation feedback included in AI's JSON output indicating success/failure and specific errors
- **ExtractionResult**: Complete output from AI processing containing extracted field data and embedded validation results
