# Feature Specification: Schema Management UI Extension

**Feature ID**: 002-schema-management-ui  
**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Dependencies**: 001-our-data-extraction (implemented)

## Overview

Extend the existing schema-driven document extraction system with a rich UI for managing document types and their schemas. This allows users to create, edit, and maintain document type definitions without code changes.

## Current State

The base feature `001-our-data-extraction` provides:
- Schema-driven document data extraction with AI validation
- Streamlit web application with modular architecture
- LiteLLM integration for Llama Scout 17B and Mistral Small 3.2
- File-based schema storage in `config.py`
- Document type selection and validation feedback UI

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Schema Management Interface**
- Rich UI for creating and editing document type schemas
- Visual field builder with drag-and-drop functionality  
- Real-time schema preview and validation
- Import/export capabilities for schema definitions

**FR2: Document Type Management**
- Create, read, update, delete document types
- Organize document types by categories (Government, Business, Personal)
- Template system for common field types and validation rules
- Schema versioning with migration support

**FR3: Field Configuration**
- Visual field editor with property panels
- Support all existing field types (string, number, date, boolean, email, phone)
- Advanced validation rule builder
- Field dependency and conditional logic setup

**FR4: Schema Validation and Testing**
- Live schema validation during editing
- Test schema against sample documents
- Validation rule testing with sample data
- Schema diff and change tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Usability**
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Progressive disclosure for advanced features
- Contextual help and guidance
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

**NFR2: Performance**  
- Schema updates apply without restart
- <500ms response time for UI interactions
- Efficient handling of large schemas (100+ fields)

**NFR3: Reliability**
- Automatic backup of schema changes
- Rollback capability for schema modifications
- Validation before saving changes
- Error recovery for malformed schemas

## User Stories

**US1: Schema Creator**
As a business analyst, I want to create new document type schemas through a visual interface so I can define extraction requirements without coding.

**US2: Schema Editor** 
As a data manager, I want to modify existing schemas to add new fields or update validation rules so I can adapt to changing document formats.

**US3: Schema Tester**
As a quality assurance specialist, I want to test schemas against sample documents so I can verify extraction accuracy before deployment.

**US4: Schema Organizer**
As a system administrator, I want to organize document types into categories and manage schema versions so I can maintain an organized schema library.

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Streamlit application architecture
- Preserve existing schema storage compatibility
- Maintain current LiteLLM processing workflow
- Support existing document types without modification
- No breaking changes to current extraction API

## Success Criteria

1. Users can create new document type schemas without code changes
2. Schema modifications are reflected immediately in extraction workflow  
3. All existing functionality remains intact
4. Schema management reduces time-to-deploy new document types by 80%
5. Non-technical users can successfully create and test schemas

## Out of Scope

- Database migration tools (current file-based approach maintained)
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Advanced schema analytics and reporting
- Integration with external schema repositories
- Automated schema generation from sample documents
