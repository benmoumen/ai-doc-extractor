## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A schema creator wants to quickly create a new document type schema without manually defining each field. They have a sample document that represents the structure they want to capture. The user uploads the sample document (PDF or image), and the system uses the same AI utilities as the main data extraction function to analyze it, automatically detecting the document type, extracting all possible field names and types, and suggesting appropriate validation rules. After AI generation, the system immediately opens the schema management interface in edit mode, allowing the user to review, modify, and refine all AI-generated elements including the document type name before saving.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has a sample PDF invoice, **When** they upload the file to the schema generator, **Then** the system analyzes the document and generates a schema with fields like "invoice_number", "date", "amount", "vendor_name" with appropriate field types and validation rules
2. **Given** the AI has generated a schema from a sample document, **When** the schema management interface opens in edit mode, **Then** the user can modify field names, types, validation rules, required status, and document type name before saving
3. **Given** a user uploads a driver's license image, **When** the AI processes it, **Then** the system generates a "Driver License" document type with fields for license number, name, address, expiration date, etc., and opens the edit interface
4. **Given** the AI encounters an unclear or ambiguous field in the sample, **When** generating the schema, **Then** the AI includes the field with its best interpretation, and the user can edit or remove it in the schema management interface

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the uploaded file is corrupted or unreadable?
- How does the system handle documents with very unusual layouts or structures?
- What occurs when the AI cannot determine appropriate field types for extracted text?
- How does the system respond when multiple possible document types could match the sample?
- What happens if the sample document contains no recognizable structured data?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload sample documents in PDF and image formats (same as main data extraction function)
- **FR-002**: System MUST use the same AI utilities as the main data extraction function to analyze uploaded sample documents and identify the document type
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract all possible field names from sample documents using AI analysis, attempting to capture every identifiable data field
- **FR-004**: System MUST infer appropriate field types (string, number, date, email, etc.) for extracted fields
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate validation rules based on field content patterns and types
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide confidence scores for AI-generated field definitions and document type classification
- **FR-007**: System MUST open the schema management interface in edit mode after AI generation, allowing users to review and edit all AI-generated schema elements before saving
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to add, remove, modify, or rename fields in the generated schema through the edit mode interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to modify the AI-generated document type name and description
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate generated schemas into the existing schema management system
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle cases where AI analysis fails or produces low-confidence results
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide feedback to users about the analysis process and any limitations or assumptions made
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate that generated schemas conform to the existing schema structure requirements
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve existing schema management features (editing, validation, import/export) for AI-generated schemas
- **FR-015**: System MUST support sample document uploads using the same upload mechanism as the main data extraction function
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle sample document processing with the same security and privacy approach as the main data extraction function
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle multi-page documents using the same processing logic as the main data extraction function
- **FR-018**: System MUST process sample documents within reasonable time limits consistent with the main data extraction function
- **FR-019**: System MUST support the same file size limits as the main data extraction function for uploaded sample documents

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Sample Document**: Represents the uploaded file used as input for AI analysis, containing document content, file metadata, and upload timestamp
- **AI Analysis Result**: Contains the AI's interpretation of the document including confidence scores, extracted fields, suggested document type, and processing metadata
- **Generated Schema**: A document schema created from AI analysis, inheriting all properties of manually created schemas but with additional metadata about its AI origin
- **Extracted Field**: Individual field definitions derived from sample analysis, including field name, inferred type, validation rules, confidence score, and source location in sample
- **Document Type Suggestion**: AI's classification of the document type with confidence score and alternative suggestions
- **Validation Rule Inference**: Automatically generated validation rules based on field content patterns, data types, and document context

- Percentage of AI-generated schemas requiring minimal user editing

### Secondary Metrics

- Number of AI-generated schemas that are saved without modifications
